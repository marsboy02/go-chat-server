   make test
   # or
   go test ./...
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes and test them:**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   make test

```

## Style Guidelines

### Go Code Style

- Follow standard Go formatting (`go fmt`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write comments for exported functions and packages
- Keep functions small and focused
- Handle errors appropriately
- Write tests for new functionality

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve WebSocket connection timeout
docs: update API documentation
refactor: improve hub message broadcasting
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functions
- Write integration tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Maintain or improve code coverage

### Documentation

- Update README.md if needed
- Update CLAUDE.md for development-related changes
- Comment complex code sections
- Update API documentation if applicable
